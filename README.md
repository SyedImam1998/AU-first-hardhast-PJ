### Hey ðŸ‘‹ Everybody this Repo is about the Alchemy week-4 Task.
- Contract/Alexam.sol contains the Week-4 final exam where we are about to call the contract (0xcF469d3BEB3Fc24cEe979eFf83BE33ed50988502) using a smart contract not EOA. So for this i created a contract called Alexam which will invoke the Alchemy contract and event is recorded on the goerli testnetwork as well.
